# Cosmic-Dilation
This is my entry into the Ludum Dare 37 game jam, which took place from December 10-12, 2016. The theme of the jam was "one room", so I made a game with just one level layout that would squash and stretch in various ways across 21 stages, thereby changing the focus of the challenge. The theming is most obvious in the code itself, in which the stage number is only ever used in a switch statement to determine how the single level layout will move. Otherwise, collision is handled in exactly the same way, no other obstacles are added or removed, and the end goal and the controls you use to reach it are identical. Out of over 1,000 submissions, I came in at #106, just shy of the top 100, though still impressively well-regarded.
