# Cosmic Dilation
This is my entry into the Ludum Dare 37 game jam, which took place from December 10-12, 2016. The theme was "one room", so I chose to create a game with just one level layout that would squash and stretch in various ways across 21 stages, thereby changing the focus of the challenge. The theme is most obvious in the code, where the stage number is only ever used to determine how the level layout will move. Otherwise, collision is handled in exactly the same way, no obstacles are added or removed, and the end goal and the controls you use to reach it are identical. Out of over 1,000 entries, my game came in at #106, just shy of the top 100, but still impressively well-received.
